# Welcome to the Didact Tutorials Registry!

*Note:* This is a work in progress and proof of concept!

The goal of this GitHub repository is to provide a location where links to tutorials of all kinds can be placed for easy access. Pick one and copy the link to make it available from within your `Didact Tutorials` view! 

## Available Tutorials

To add these tutorials to the Didact Tutoriasl view in your local VS Code workspace, do the following:

* Copy the link text for the tutorial from this page.
* Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), type `Didact: Process vscode link from web`, and press enter. 
* Paste the tutorial link text and hit enter.

* Requirements Example - Provides examples of how to handle requirements checking in Didact tutorials.
